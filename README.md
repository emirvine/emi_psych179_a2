This repository contains the code relevant for PSYC 179 Assignment 2.

Here, we use an example session to apply the co-occurrance on the neurons. We separate out the place cells that have fields on the U, shortcut, and novel segments. The plots are from Pause A (before the novel segments were introduced) and Pause B (before the rat was able to traverse the novel segments.)

The co_occur_shortcut.m script contains the majority of the code. Spikes were attributed to different maze segments using the code in track_spike_times.ipynb. Results from this script are in cooccurrence_r063_pA.png and cooccurrence_r063_pB.png.
