## Neural data analysis Project 2

This repository contains the code relevant for PSYC 179 Project 2.

Here, we use an example session to apply the co-occurrence on the neurons. We separate out the place cells that have fields on the U, shortcut, and novel segments. The plots are from Pause A (before the novel segments were introduced) and Pause B (before the rat was able to traverse the novel segments.)

The following scripts contain the more interesting pieces for this analysis:
- co_occur_shortcut.m (Contains the majority of the code)
- track_spike_times.ipynb (Attributing spikes to different occurring on maze segments) 
- Results (plots) in cooccurrence_r063_pA.png and cooccurrence_r063_pB.png.
